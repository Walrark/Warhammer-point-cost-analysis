This is a project which I did for fun during spring and early summer of 2023.
In this project I am attempting to analyze what units are effective against specific units in the boardgame: Warhammer 40,000 9th ed.
To do this I set up a system for quantitative data using probability, and started a qualitative weighting scheme as well. 
The project includes an interpolation of items which are effective vs the target unit using a polynomial regression.
I ultimately didn't finish the project as they changed the edition part way through my work, and it completely changed how the code would need to be structured.
